When a tasks.md file is created in any spec folder (.kiro/specs/*/tasks.md), automatically generate comprehensive test files that:

1. Read the requirements from .kiro/specs/*/requirements.md to identify all user stories
2. Read the design from .kiro/specs/*/design.md to understand the tech stack, project structure, and architecture
3. Create test files following TDD principles:
   - Tests should be executable with no compilation or syntax errors
   - Tests should fail predictably with "not yet implemented" or similar messages
   - Cover ALL user stories from requirements.md
   - Use the appropriate testing framework based on the tech stack in design.md
   - Follow the project structure defined in design.md
   - Include proper test setup, teardown, and assertions
   - Use descriptive test names that map directly to user stories

4. Place test files in the appropriate location based on the project structure in design.md
5. Include a comment at the top of each test file indicating which user stories it covers

The tests should serve as executable specifications that guide implementation and turn green as features are built.
